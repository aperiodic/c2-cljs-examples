# c2-cljs-examples

A few of the C2 demos, in clojurescript.

## Usage

Compile the clojurescript with `lein cljsbuild once`, build the html by running
`./dev/bin/htmlbuild.sh` from the project's root, and then open one of the html
files in `resources/public` in your browser.

Or just check out [the online version][ghp].
